This giant reprap il not perfect. I started the design few months ago, at the very beggining of i3, and i2 was the star.

I decided to build my own big Drinter (3D+printer=DRINTER) (en Francais, inDrimante, ca le fait aussi ! ou une constructante ? ^^) 
So this design is fully scalable. If you want to build a middle sized one, you can just assemble the left half of mine and the right the original i2, it's design for !


What can you build with this big baby ? I finding uses for every day (seriously) and start to think one is not enought

You'll see in the manual and howto that I designed 2 bed motion motor mounts. Because the bed weight can dramaticaly increase, you can use many motor and NEMA 17 Or NEMA 23
I use two nema23 with their own driver (one driver for one motor NEMA 23 - I will put "hack" wiring and pics in my "how to" and "Why did you")

It's working really great, better than I expect : no heat at all of drivers and motor at... 110mm/s printing speed ! 

To get it on line, you need to set it up correctly in many ways but 


... IT DEFINITLY WORKS GREAT !


BAAAAM !
