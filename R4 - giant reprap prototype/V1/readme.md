Wanted : help for auto leveling integration.

Hi Folks ! 
If you are reading this, you are seriously folowing my incoming job !

Here, you can find the real revolution of 3D printing, a seriously big reprap, up to 1,5meter by 2m by 2,8m height. 

This design is nearly done and first build is at 80%. 
All design will be released as soon as the 1st machine will work, BOM and instruction will take more time to be completed. 

The machine is build from steel, NO ALUMINIUM (I'm concerned about polution and deceases the metal create)

The machine Is scalable


Its name is : R4 - Really Repplicant RepRap / Reprap Reèllement Réplicante.


The Bom will be around 2000€ for a 1m X 1m X 1.5m printable space if you do everything by yourself.
Kits will be available at Excellence3d.com soon, from 3600€ all included, 2 hot head full metal. 
Assembled and working Drinter will be available at many finish level (simple painted wood and raw steel to deluxe LED illuminated glass with falling water effects !)


I will complete early giant print this September2014. 

Hope you'll enjoy it !
